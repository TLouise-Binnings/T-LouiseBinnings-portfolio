About this site:

I am a Biology student at CSUMB with a concentration in Ecology and Evolution, and a passion for Plant Science, Chemistry, and Mathematics. My work with local farm-based food businesses, coupled with social justice farm education lead me back to academia to complete my undergraduate. While in school, I have worked as both a supplementary instructor and teacher's assistant in plant science and chemistry. My experience working with students in STEM courses has spurred my interest in building ways for STEM education support throughout all areas of academia.
